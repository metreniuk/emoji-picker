## Details
- The width of the Emoji Picker is larger than in the layout. This is done so that the content behaves consistently when the option `Settings/General/Show scroll bars/Always` is enabled on a Mac. For this reason, there is a larger margin on the right. Slack has similar behavior.
- The "Frequently used" category is formed based on the frequency of use of a particular emoji.
